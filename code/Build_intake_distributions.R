#This script combines the COSOMO AgiLink with the SPADE output to produce distributions of intakes

#step 1: read COSOMO AgiLink model mean values

#step 2: in case the model shows an average value for country, disagrregate each country to derive age-sex groups mean values per location

#step 3: read Simone's database distribution

#step 4: Use Method of Moments and fits to build means and distribution for each of the age-sex-location-meat/omega n-3/micronutrient group
