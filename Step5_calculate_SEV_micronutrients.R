# calculate changes in SEV (pervalence of micronutrient deficiencies) for various micronutrients for the baseline
#and high road scenarios and compare. The differences is the change in population level severity of prevalence for each age-sex-location group.






#step 1: calculate SEVs for micronutrient deficiencies. Per age-sex_location-micronutrient and scenario:


#step 2: compare the changes in SEV per age-sex-location-micronutrient between the high road and the baseline


#step 3: Plot on a map or bubbles
